        "blog": "In JavaScript REACT when we want to send data from a parent component to a child component we usually use props. But When we talk about a complex situation where we need to pass data through the multi-level component by using props it would be very difficult. To bring the solution to this problem came the 'CONTEXT API'. In this method first, we declare a JavaScript REACT hook named 'useContext' then we put all the child where we need to pass data on the 'CONTEXT' state. Then we pass data by using Provider . After all, we can easily access that passed data from any child where the level doesn't  Matter. "
